						<h2>What is disability?</h2>
						<p class="fragment">Disability is part of being human.</p>
						<p class="fragment">Disability results from the interaction between individuals with a health condition, such as cerebral palsy, Down syndrome and depression, with personal and environmental factors including negative attitudes, inaccessible transportation and public buildings, and limited social support.</p>

						<h2>Vision disabilities</h2>

					<section>
						<h3>Blindness</h3>
						<p>Blindness is the inability to see or a lack of vision. In the most severe cases, there's an inability to see even light. It also means that you can't correct your vision with eyeglasses, contact lenses, eye drops or other medical therapy, or surgery.</p>
						<p><small>clevelandclinic.org</small></p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Low vision</h3>
						<p>Low vision is a permanent visual impairment that you can't correct with glasses, contacts or surgery. Most eye doctors define low vision as moderate to severe visual impairment — enough to inhibit your everyday activities, like driving and reading.</p>
						<p><small>clevelandclinic.org</small></p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Colour blindness</h3>
						<p>Colour blindness (colour vision deficiency) is a fairly common condition in which you don't see colours in a traditional way.</p>
